   * way to fail is a blob transaction whose blobs this node does not hold — which is every eth/72
   * transaction on arrival, and permanently so for one this node only ever samples.
   *
   * <p>Callers serving or announcing to a peer should skip a transaction this rejects, rather than
   * discovering the gap while encoding: the blob list of such a transaction is a list of nulls, so
   * encoding it fails with a {@link NullPointerException} well away from the cause. Deciding it
   * here also keeps serving and announcing consistent — announcing a transaction to a peer whose
   * protocol version we could not then serve claims an availability we do not have.
